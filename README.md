# Svelte Datepicker

This is a near total rewrite of the excellent [https://github.com/6eDesign/svelte-calendar](Svelte Calendar). It provides:

* Date Picker
* Date Range Picker
* Time Selection
* Better Responsiveness
* Improved theming
* Context-aware theming

Roadmap:

* Re-introduce Keyboard Support
